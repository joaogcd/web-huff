- **Live Application:** [https://web-huff.netlify.app/](https://web-huff.netlify.app/)

## About the Project

Web Huff is an educational and practical project that implements the **Huffman Compression Algorithm**, a lossless compression method widely used in formats such as ZIP, GZIP, JPEG, and MP3.

### What is Huffman Coding?

Huffman Coding is a greedy algorithm that assigns variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence. More frequent characters receive shorter codes, resulting in efficient compression without data loss.

### Key Features

- **Lossless Compression** - Complete recovery of original text
- **Statistics Visualization** - Real-time compression rate and efficiency
- **Binary Tree Construction** - Based on character frequency
- **Text File Compression** - Support for upload and download
- **Intuitive Interface** - Modern and responsive user experience
- **Reversible Process** - Compression and decompression in the browser


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure of the application
- **CSS3** - Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Compression/decompression logic and DOM manipulation
- **Netlify** - Hosting and continuous deployment

## How It Works

### Compression Algorithm

1. **Frequency Calculation** - Analyzes the frequency of each character in the text
2. **Huffman Tree Construction** - Creates a bottom-up binary tree
3. **Code Generation** - Assigns unique binary codes to each character
4. **Encoding** - Replaces characters with their binary codes
5. **Result** - Compressed text with reduced bit size

### Compression Efficiency

The compression rate can vary from **~33%** (text with a single character) to **~87.5%** (text with highly repetitive patterns). The algorithm is optimal for character-based compression, especially effective for texts with unequal character distribution.

## Usage

![Application Screenshot](./assets/web-huff-usage.gif)

1. Open the [live application](https://web-huff.netlify.app/).
2. Paste or upload a text file to compress.
3. Click "Compress" to see the compressed output and statistics.
4. To decompress, paste the compressed text and click "Decompress".
5. Download the results as needed.

## Use Cases

### Educational

- Learn about data structures (binary trees, priority queues)
- Understand lossless compression algorithms
- Visualize the practical functioning of Huffman Coding

### Practical

- Compress text before transmitting or storing
- Compare compression efficiency across different texts
- Demonstrate information theory and entropy concepts

### Development

- Foundation for implementing more complex compressors
- Component of text processing systems
- Reference for encoding algorithms

## Compression Examples

### Repetitive Text

**Input:** "aaaaaabbbbcccd"  
**Compression Rate:** ~75%  
**Reason:** High repetition allows very short codes

### Varied Text

**Input:** "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"  
**Compression Rate:** ~40-50%  
**Reason:** More uniform character distribution

### Unique Text

**Input:** "abcdefghijklmnop"  
**Compression Rate:** ~33%  
**Reason:** Each character appears once, codes cannot be optimized
